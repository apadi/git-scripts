# git-scripts
Custom scripts to extend git built in commands

You can extend and customize git through command aliases. You can also add entirely new commands.

Place any executable with a name like git-squash in your PATH and git will automatically make it available as a subcommand.

This project contains some useful "git commands". To use it just add the project folder to $PATH (or simply run the setup script)
